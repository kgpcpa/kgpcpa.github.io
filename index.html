      <h3>A responsive, trust-worthy, approachable CPA</h3>

      <p>
        Katy understands that finding a CPA who is a good fit for you and/or your business can be no easy task. Her practice is exclusively referral-based and most potential clients come to her seeking a responsive, trust-worthy, approachable CPA, all qualities Katy whole-heartedly embodies.      
      </p>

      <p>
        Her patience, clear communication style, and attention to detail are some of her greatest strengths, making navigating the tax code appear simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        Katy’s greatest value can be added through proactive planning.  She relies on her clients to communicate their goals and upcoming financial decisions that could significantly impact their tax scenario to her.  While the tax implications of any situation may not be the ultimate driver of the decision made, often there are tax roadblocks and pitfalls to consider during the process / along the way.
